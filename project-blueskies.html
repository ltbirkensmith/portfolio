            <p class="section-text">
                PH-LORA (Pheromonal Localized Overpopulation Regulation Aircraft) is an integrated aerial pheromone delivery system that revolutionizes agricultural pest management. The system combines autonomous drones, AI-powered pest monitoring, and precision pheromone application to provide a sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides, addressing urgent environmental and public health concerns in modern agriculture.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Traditional chemical pesticides create serious hazards from carcinogenic effects to soil infertility, while also leading to pesticide resistance in insect populations. Our solution transforms pheromonal pest control—a previously impractical approach due to complex application requirements—into a viable automated system through innovative integration of UAV technology and artificial intelligence.

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Detection Phase:</strong> Oracle ground stations continuously monitor fields using AI-powered computer vision to identify pest species, developmental stages, and population density. When sexually mature insects are detected at threshold levels, Oracle transmits location data to the PH-LORA system.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Deployment Phase:</strong> PH-LORA autonomously selects and loads the appropriate species-specific pheromone solution from its docking station, navigates to the impacted zone using preset flight formulas optimized for target species behavior, and precisely applies the pheromone treatment using multi-nozzled deployment mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Return Phase:</strong> The drone returns to its charging/resupply dock using 360-degree aerial awareness, automatically recharges, and stands ready for the next deployment based on Oracle's continued monitoring.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Technical Innovation</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Precision Application:</strong> Retractable deployment mechanism with multi-nozzled bottom allows full coverage from crop base to top, adapting spray pattern based on where target pest species mate. Smart-release mechanisms use location data for optimal positioning with active stabilization in varying wind conditions.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>AI-Driven Decision Making:</strong> Machine learning algorithms trained on diverse pest lifecycle data enable accurate species identification and maturation tracking. Predictive modeling anticipates potential outbreaks based on historical data and current environmental conditions, allowing proactive rather than reactive pest management.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Automated Supply Chain:</strong> Smart docking infrastructure serves as comprehensive hub for takeoff/landing, battery charging, and autonomous pheromone loading. System supports 24/7 deployment capability, satisfying complex species-specific application requirements that previously made pheromone treatments impractical at scale.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Use Case: Navel Orangeworm in Almonds</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Our initial deployment focuses on Navel Orangeworm (NOW) control in California almond farms. This use case was selected because almond production is concentrated in a single region, almonds are high-value crops, and effective pheromone treatments (CheckMate NOW-F) already exist but require labor-intensive manual application.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Economic Analysis:</strong> Traditional chemical pesticide costs approximately $93 per acre plus $300 for mummy nut sanitation. Our pheromone treatment costs $120 per acre but offers greater economic benefits by reducing crop loss and enabling premium organic market positioning. The system pays for itself through reduced pesticide costs and increased yield quality.

                <strong>Safety Compliance:</strong> Pheromones are non-toxic to humans and non-target species, presenting minimal environmental risk compared to chemical pesticides. Advanced aerial navigation systems detect and avoid human presence, ensuring operational safety in agricultural environments.
