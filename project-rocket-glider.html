            <p class="section-text">
                For Columbia's Art of Engineering Introductory Lab Class, our team was challenged to design and build a rocket-powered glider featuring a sliding wing mechanism. This project combined aerodynamics, propulsion, mechanical design, and manufacturing into a single integrated system that had to perform reliably during a live launch demonstration.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                The sliding wing mechanism added significant complexity—the wing needed to deploy smoothly during flight while maintaining structural integrity under aerodynamic loads. Our team earned an A+ grade through careful design analysis, precision manufacturing, and successful flight demonstration of our final product.

            <h2 class="section-title">Design Challenges</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Sliding Wing Mechanism:</strong> The core challenge was designing a wing that could deploy during flight while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency and structural stability. The mechanism needed to be lightweight, reliable, and capable of withstanding both the launch acceleration forces and subsequent aerodynamic loads during glide.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Weight vs. Strength Trade-off:</strong> Rocket-powered models require careful weight management to achieve adequate altitude while ensuring sufficient structural strength to survive launch stresses. Every component needed optimization to balance these competing requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Aerodynamic Optimization:</strong> Wing design required balancing lift generation for extended glide time against drag minimization for altitude achievement. Flow simulation analysis informed airfoil selection and planform geometry to achieve optimal lift-to-drag ratio for the mission profile.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Wing Design Process</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Airfoil Selection:</strong> Analyzed various airfoil geometries for suitability to the expected Reynolds number range and flight speeds. Selected an airfoil optimized for low-speed gliding performance with gentle stall characteristics for controllability.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Planform Design:</strong> Determined optimal wing span, chord length, and aspect ratio to maximize glide efficiency while maintaining compatibility with the sliding mechanism. Higher aspect ratio provides better aerodynamic efficiency but requires stronger structural design.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Structural Analysis:</strong> Ensured wing structure could withstand bending moments from lift distribution and torsional loads from aerodynamic center offset. Incorporated sufficient ribs and spars while minimizing weight through strategic material removal.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">CFD Analysis & Validation</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Using SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation, I conducted computational fluid dynamics analysis to predict wing performance before manufacturing. The analysis provided preliminary drag coefficient values that informed final design decisions and helped predict glide performance.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Simulation Parameters:</strong> Configured flow conditions matching expected flight speeds during boost phase (high velocity) and glide phase (lower velocity). Analyzed pressure distributions, flow separation patterns, and drag contributions from various wing sections.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Design Iterations:</strong> CFD results guided design refinements including wing tip shaping to reduce induced drag, surface smoothness requirements for boundary layer management, and control surface sizing for adequate stability.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Manufacturing Process</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Laser Cutting:</strong> Manufactured wing components using precision laser cutter, enabling accurate reproduction of the designed geometry. Laser cutting provided clean edges and consistent dimensions critical for aerodynamic performance and assembly fit.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Material Selection:</strong> Used lightweight balsa wood and thin plywood for wing structure, selected for favorable strength-to-weight ratio and compatibility with laser cutting. Material thickness optimized for structural requirements while minimizing weight penalty.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Assembly Techniques:</strong> Assembled wing structure using wood glue and pinning, ensuring proper alignment of ribs, spars, and skin. Applied lightweight covering material for aerodynamic surface smoothness while adding minimal weight.

            <h2 class="section-title">Team Integration & Assembly</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Worked collaboratively with three team members, each responsible for different subsystems (fuselage, sliding mechanism, propulsion system, and my wing design). Regular team meetings ensured component compatibility and coordinated assembly sequence.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>System Integration:</strong> Combined individual components into cohesive flight vehicle, resolving interface challenges and ensuring proper center of gravity location. Sliding mechanism had to align precisely with wing mounting points while allowing smooth deployment motion.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Testing & Validation:</strong> Conducted ground tests of sliding mechanism operation, checked control surface movements, and verified structural integrity before flight. Performed trim adjustments and balance checks to ensure stable flight characteristics.

            <h2 class="section-title">Flight Demonstration</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                The final project milestone was a live launch demonstration where our rocket-powered glider had to successfully boost to altitude, deploy the sliding wing mechanism, and perform a controlled glide back to earth. Our design performed successfully, demonstrating the effectiveness of our engineering analysis and careful construction.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Launch Configuration:</strong> Wing positioned in streamlined configuration during boost phase to minimize drag and maximize altitude. Rocket motor provided thrust for vertical ascent to deployment altitude.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Wing Deployment:</strong> At apogee, sliding mechanism activated to deploy wing into glide configuration. Smooth deployment critical for maintaining control and avoiding tumbling.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Glide Performance:</strong> Deployed glider demonstrated stable, controlled descent with gentle spiral glide pattern. Extended flight duration validated aerodynamic design and confirmed CFD predictions.
