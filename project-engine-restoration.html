            <p class="section-text">
                I recently acquired three antique nitromethane-fueled model airplane engines, vintage powerplants that hadn't been run since 1992—over 30 years of sitting dormant. These small but complex two-stroke engines represent a fascinating intersection of mechanical engineering, chemistry, and aviation history. Through systematic troubleshooting, careful disassembly, and meticulous refinishing of engine surfaces, I successfully brought one of the three engines back to operational condition.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                This project combines mechanical restoration, diagnostic problem-solving, and hands-on machining skills. Each engine presented unique challenges from decades of corrosion, fuel residue buildup, and worn components. The restoration process required understanding two-stroke engine mechanics, fuel chemistry, and precision metalworking to return these engines to running condition.

            <h2 class="section-title">Restoration Process</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Initial Assessment:</strong> Conducted thorough visual inspection and compression testing to evaluate each engine's condition. Identified seized pistons, corroded cylinder walls, clogged fuel passages, and oxidized bearing surfaces as primary issues requiring attention.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Disassembly:</strong> Carefully documented original configuration and component placement before systematic disassembly. Removed cylinder head, piston assembly, crankshaft, and carburetor components. Special care was taken with vintage gaskets and seals that would need replacement.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Cleaning & Refinishing:</strong> Used appropriate solvents to remove decades of fuel varnish and carbon deposits. Employed fine abrasives and polishing compounds to restore cylinder bore surfaces without removing excessive material. Cleaned all fuel passages using wire and chemical methods.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Component Rehabilitation:</strong> Assessed wear on critical components including piston rings, connecting rod bearings, and crankshaft journals. Refinished or replaced worn parts as necessary. Re-lapped piston to cylinder for proper fit and compression.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Reassembly & Testing:</strong> Carefully reassembled engine with fresh gaskets and proper lubrication. Performed initial break-in procedure with appropriate fuel mixture. Tuned carburetor for optimal performance across RPM range.

            <ul class="achievements-list">
                <li>Removing seized pistons without damaging cylinder walls required careful application of penetrating oil and heat cycling</li>
                <li>Sourcing or fabricating replacement gaskets for engines no longer in production</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Engine Mechanics: Two-Stroke & Nitromethane</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Two-Stroke Operation:</strong> Unlike four-stroke engines, these model engines complete a power cycle in just two strokes of the piston—compression and power. This design achieves high power-to-weight ratio crucial for model aircraft but requires precise port timing and lubrication delivered through the fuel mixture.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Nitromethane Fuel:</strong> These engines run on a specialized fuel mixture containing nitromethane, methanol, and lubricating oil. Nitromethane acts as both fuel and oxidizer, allowing engines to achieve remarkably high power output. However, it's highly corrosive and hygroscopic, which contributed to the extensive corrosion after decades of storage.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Compression & Carburetion:</strong> Model engines rely on extremely high compression ratios and precise fuel-air mixture control. The carburetor must atomize fuel effectively at high RPM (typically 10,000-20,000 RPM) while providing enough lubrication to prevent seizure.

                <strong>Engine 1 (Operational):</strong> Successfully restored to running condition. Achieves good compression, starts reliably, and runs smoothly across RPM range. Carburetor properly tuned for stable idle and full throttle operation. Currently being tested for extended run times to ensure reliability.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Engines 2 & 3 (Under Maintenance):</strong> Both engines present additional challenges requiring more extensive work. Engine 2 has significant cylinder wall scoring that may require re-boring or sleeve installation. Engine 3 has a bent crankshaft that needs replacement or straightening—exploring options for sourcing compatible parts from similar vintage engines.

            <p class="section-text">
                These engines represent an important era in model aviation history. Before modern electric motors and lithium batteries, nitromethane engines were the standard powerplant for serious model aircraft. They offered unmatched power-to-weight ratio and the authentic sound and smell of real aviation. Restoring these engines preserves both mechanical engineering heritage and model aviation history.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                The skills and knowledge required to maintain these engines—understanding carburetion, compression ratios, port timing, and fuel chemistry—represent a depth of mechanical expertise that's increasingly rare in our modern electric-powered world.

            <p class="section-text">
                Continue restoration work on the remaining two engines, potentially sourcing parts from donor engines or machining custom replacements. Once all three are operational, plan to install them in period-appropriate model aircraft to demonstrate their capabilities. May also document the restoration process in detail to help others working on similar vintage engines.
